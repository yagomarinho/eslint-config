# eslint-config

This repository contains **my personal ESLint configuration**, extracted from how I actually write and maintain code.

It reflects my **coding style preferences**, opinions, and trade-offs developed through real projects — mainly with **TypeScript** and **React**.

This is **not meant to be a generic or educational config**. It exists primarily so I can reuse the same rules across my projects and keep my code consistent.

---

## What this config represents

- Preference for **pragmatic TypeScript** (strict where it adds value, flexible where it doesn’t)
- Strong emphasis on **consistency and readability**
- Formatting fully delegated to **Prettier**
- Clear rules around imports and project structure
- React patterns that match how I usually write components

In short: this is the ESLint setup I enjoy working with on a daily basis.

---

## Scope

The rules are shaped around:

- TypeScript-first projects
- React / Next.js codebases
- Modern ESLint Flat Config

Nothing more, nothing less.

---

## Notes

This config will evolve as my preferences evolve.

If it’s useful to someone else, that’s great — but it’s not the primary goal.
